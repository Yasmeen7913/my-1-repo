      <div class="cont2">
        <p>Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting movement and cognition. 
                It's characterized by tremors, stiffness, and impaired balance. Early detection is crucial for 
                effective management and intervention. Predicting Parkinson's involves assessing various symptoms 
                and risk factors, often through medical evaluations and diagnostic tests. Emerging technologies 
                like machine learning and data analysis play a role in predictive models, aiding in early 
                identification and personalized treatment plans for individuals at risk.</p>
